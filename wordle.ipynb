        "In early 2022, the game wordle started taking social media by storm. It's a fun game where players have six guesses to figure out a five letter word. The more I thought about it, the more I decided that it would be the perfect teaching tool for Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods - both classical and neural. By the end of this notebook you should be able to write an some algorithms to play the game as well as understand the fundamentals behind natural Lannguage processing"
